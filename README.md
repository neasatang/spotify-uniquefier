# spotify-uniquefier
Creates a Spotify playlist that finds the unique songs between two playlists and puts them into a new playlist

Firstly, you must have the Spotipy library imported. Just type "pip install spotipy" into the terminal.

Next, in the Developer section of spotify, create an App and get your client id and client secret from there.
Into the terminal type in "export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='insert_client_id'" "export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='insert_client_secret'"  "export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='insert_redirect_uri'". Ensure that the redirect uri matches the redirect uri from your Spotify App page.
